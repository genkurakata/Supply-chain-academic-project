# Executive Summary
The DHL supply chain is the thought leader on sustainability in the industry, as it was the first logistics company to set a quantified carbon efficiency goal: 30% off of its carbon dioxide emissions across global operations compared to its 2007 baseline. We, the DHL Solutions Team have come up with an optimization that can help the DHL supply chain reach this lofty goal. We ran a simulation exercise for a consumer electronic company, with the goal to see how much carbon dioxide emissions we can cut with a 10% increase in budget; we are anticipating a tax incentive from the government in the form of 10%. With this increased budget, we drastically reduced emissions and also reduced costs at the same time so these funds could be allocated elsewhere in the supply chain. At the same time, the brand value for the supply chain will increase because of DHL supply chainâ€™s leadership role in reducing emissions in the logistics industry. While this one operation does not represent the entire company, this simulation can be used as a blueprint for other operations in the supply chain to reduce total carbon dioxide emissions.

## Case study on DHL for my DS 655 course

For my Sustainable Supply Chain Management course that I took for my major, we did a case study project on DHL's supply chain for LCD monitors. Using the data provided from the overview, the goal and constraints of the project were determined. I used the Solver add-in in Microsoft Excel to solve the problem through the use of linear programming.
